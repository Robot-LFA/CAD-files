# Overview
This repository contains files associated with the manuscript, "Automated liquid handling robot for rapid lateral flow assay development" by Anderson and Huynh et al. Included in this repo are CAD files which correspond to the four LFA holder designs (v1 to v4) described in the manuscript. 

# Usage 
The holders were created using different methods. 

- V1 was designed using machined aluminum, with a bottom base made of stainless steel. A stainless steel threaded rod (10-32) serves to guide the aluminum pinch points, and plastic nuts included for adjusting position in two directions. 

- V2 and V3 were 3D printed using Vero inks on a polyjet printer (Stratasys J750), and an aluminum bottom base to contain 2 sets of 3 threaded holes to attach the 3D printed top piece. 

- V4 with a 1/4" thick aluminum sheet (40 by 48) with two pin holes that guide a clear acrylic sheet (1/16") laser cut to fit the LFA cassettes. 

Additional information can be found in the supplemental information.
